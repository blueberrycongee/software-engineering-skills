description: Standards and checklists for multi-developer software collaboration, branching, commits, PRs, coding conventions, API/database/logging rules, and code review. Use when asked to draft/update engineering collaboration guidelines, enforce team norms, review code against standards, or summarize required practices for workflow, design, and tooling.

# Se Collab Standards

## Overview

Use the collaboration and engineering standards in `references/handbook.md` to produce policy docs, review checklists, or compliance guidance. Keep outputs aligned to the referenced rules and avoid inventing new standards unless explicitly requested.

## Workflow

1. Identify the user intent (guidelines draft, review checklist, enforcement note, or Q&A).
2. Load `references/handbook.md` and use only the relevant sections.
3. Preserve the original structure and terminology unless the user asks to adapt it.
4. If repository- or language-specific rules conflict with the handbook, ask for clarification instead of overriding.
5. For code review requests, map each finding to the checklist categories and call out missing tests or edge cases.
