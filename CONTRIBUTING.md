# Contributing

Thanks for helping grow this skills collection.

## What is a skill?

A skill is a folder that contains a required `SKILL.md` and optional `scripts/`,
`references/`, or `assets/`. Keep skills self-contained and minimal.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Add or update a skill under `skills/<skill-name>/`.
3. Ensure `SKILL.md` includes YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`.
4. Avoid adding extra docs inside a skill (no README/CHANGELOG, etc.).
5. Open a PR and describe the intent, trigger phrases, and example usage.

## Naming rules

- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only.
- Keep names short and verb-led when possible.

## Quality checklist

- The `description` is explicit about when the skill should trigger.
- The `SKILL.md` body is concise and imperative.
- Reference files are linked from `SKILL.md` with clear use cases.
- Scripts are executable and tested if included.
